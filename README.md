# hand-controlled-buzzer
Turn your fingers into a musical instrument! This project tracks your thumb and index finger distance using your webcam and MediaPipe, sends that data to an Arduino, which then plays a buzzer tone with a pitch that changes as you move your fingers closer or farther. Simple, fun, and hands-on sound control! ðŸŽ¶ðŸ¤š
